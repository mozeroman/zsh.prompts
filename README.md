# steps install agnoster with zsh-prezto
-	Install those otf files to enable fonts for the themes
-	Put prompt_agnoster_setup into both user & root in ~/.zprezto/modules/prompt/functions/
-	copy indexs in git-omz.zsh & get-short-path.zsh into both ~/.zpreztorc (position doesn't matter, if in another file would be fine too)
-	logout and restart to enable both fonts & load theme
-	change 'theme' in ~/.zpreztorc to 'agnoster' if needed


# Modified 'agnoster' theme

Modified specifically for use with [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto).
Also fully compatible with [YADR](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) as it incorporates Prezto as a sub-module.

Please be aware that I've intentionally left this theme with the original name as I didn't create it.  All I did was modify it for use with Prezto/YADR.

## Prerequisites

-	A Powerline-patched font, as per the [original gist's documentation](https://gist.github.com/3712874)
-	For YADR, [git.zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/lib/git.zsh) file from Oh-My-Zsh.  You can get a copy of this file from the [downloads page associated with this repository](https://github.com/digitalformula/zsh.prompts/downloads).  Extract the archive and put the contents in ~/.yadr/zsh.
-	For YADR, a copy of the `get-short-path` function from the [downloads page](https://github.com/digitalformula/zsh.prompts/downloads).  Extract the archive and put the contents in ~/.yadr/zsh.

Please note that I can't cover all possible variations of ZSH-modifications projects.  If you don't use YADR, you'll need to make sure the above scripts are loaded, preferably through ~/.zpreztorc.

For example, `source git-omz.zsh` and/or `source get-short-path.zsh`.

## Installation - [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)

-	Grab prompt_agnoster_setup from this repo
-	Put the file in ~/.zprezto/modules/prompt/functions/
-	Restart your ZSH session
-	Run `prompt agnoster` to make sure the theme loaded properly
-	Modify ~/.zprezto to load this theme by looking for a line similar to the following:
	-	zstyle ':prezto:module:prompt' theme 'theme name here'
	-	Replace 'theme name here' with 'agnoster'
-	Restart your ZSH session, or start a new one
